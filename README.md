## Will this break my panel? (IMPORTANT)
This will not break your panel unless you use a diffrent theme version for a diffrent panel version, if it for some reason does break your panel it is simple to remove the theme.

## Panel Versioning
Make sure that the theme you are installing corresponds with the version of the panel you are running; no help will be given if you have mismatched versions!
